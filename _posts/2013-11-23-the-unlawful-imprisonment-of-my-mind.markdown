summary: |
     I have always supported Capitalism. Just like most other people, freedom is among the most fundamental of rights I cherish and Capitalism appeared to protect it better than other economic models. Being an entrepreneur (of fairly limited consequence I must add), a system that supported and rewarded independent innovation seemed right.
